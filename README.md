## Introduction

## Building

Compile the library from TypeScript to JavaScript.

The following command is available:

- `npm run build`

  Builds the library

## Tests

There are three types of tests:

- **Unit Tests**

  These tests have no dependencies outside the tested file (exception: class inheritance). All dependencies are mocked.

  A test coverage of 100% should be achieved.

- **Integration Tests**

  These tests have no dependencies outside the project. All dependencies in the package.json file are mocked.
  Small libraries, e.g. lodash or luxon, don't need to be mocked.

  A test coverage between 50% and 75% should be achieved.

- **Functional Tests**

  These tests are performed with all dependencies and take a long time. External services, e.g. MySQL, will/must be provided via docker.

  No dependency should be mocked.

  A test coverage between 50% and 75% should be achieved.

**The following commands are available:**

## Prettier and Lint

Ensures that the code is formatted uniformly and that the coding standards are adhered to.

The following commands are available:

- `npm run prettier`

  Changes the code formatting as defined in the Prettier setting.
